Hi there👋, I’m vakanoule1! 

I am Diaby, a computer science graduate from John Jay College of Criminal Justice in Manhattan New York, a CompTIA A+ certified, a CompTIA Cybersecurity Analyst (CySA+) trained  and a fellow in Data Science at The Knowledge House in Stamford Connecticut.

During my time at John Jay College and the Knowledge House, I was involved in several research projects including operating systems vulnerability to attacks to help people use computer systems effectively and developing a Health monitoring app to better manage our blood pressure.

In addition to my academic work, I also worked as a STEM Instructor at Norwalk Housing Authority and as an educator at Kelly Education in Bridgeport Connecticut where I helped 98%  of students excel in Science and math.

My experience at John Jay College, at The Knowledge House, at Norwalk Housing Authority and at Kelly Education have given me the skills and knowledge necessary to make a meaningful contribution to any team.

I am particularly excited about data analysis, visualization and managing large data sets using Python and SQL.


👀 I’m expanding my knowledge in cyber security and data science.
🌱 I’m currently working on several projects in data science.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on github on exciting data science projects.
